## Notes for Reviewers

The AI adversaries feature has been implemented with three difficulty levels: easy, medium, and hard. The adversaries move on the game board and interact with the snake, adding an extra layer of challenge to the game. The README.md file has been updated with information about this new feature, and tests have been added to ensure the functionality works as expected.

Please review the proposed AI adversary mechanics and suggest any improvements or concerns. Particular attention should be paid to the balance of difficulty levels and how they affect overall gameplay.
