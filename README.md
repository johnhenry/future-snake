Future Snake is a modern take on the classic Snake game. This project aims to create an engaging and visually appealing version of Snake with additional features and gameplay elements.

- `game.js`: The main JavaScript file that implements the game logic.
- `test.js`: Contains tests for the game's functionality.

## Features

### Core Gameplay

### Gravity Wells
