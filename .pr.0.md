## Description

Create a snake game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It should have all sorts of futuristic elements and mechanics.

## Tasks

- [x] Create list of mechanics
- [x] Create storyline
- [x] Implement code
- [x] Implement tests

## Notes for Reviewers

- A game design document has been created in `game_design.md` with a list of futuristic mechanics and a storyline for the game. Please review this document for the proposed game features and narrative.
- The basic structure of the game has been implemented in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The following files have been created:

  - `index.html`: Contains the game structure and UI elements
  - `styles.css`: Provides futuristic styling for the game
  - `game.js`: Implements the game logic and mechanics

- Implemented features:

  1. Neon Trails: The snake is drawn with a glowing effect
  2. Teleportation: Players can press 'T' to teleport to a random location (costs energy)
  3. Shape-shifting: Players can press 'S' to remove a segment of the snake (costs energy)
  4. Energy Management: The snake consumes energy over time and when using special abilities

- Future improvements:

  1. Implement Time Manipulation power-ups
  2. Add Gravity Wells to the game board
  3. Introduce Holographic Obstacles
  4. Develop AI Adversaries
  5. Create Quantum Food with multiple states
  6. Implement multi-dimensional play (2D/3D perspective shifts)

- Testing:

  - A basic test file `test.js` has been created to demonstrate the approach for testing the game.
  - The test file includes simple unit tests for core game functionalities such as initialization, snake movement, collision detection, teleportation, and shape-shifting.
  - For a production-ready game, more comprehensive unit tests and integration tests should be implemented to ensure game stability and correct functionality of all features.
  - Consider using a proper testing framework like Jest or Mocha for more robust testing in the future.

- Next steps:
  1. Expand the test suite to cover all game functionalities
  2. Implement the future improvements listed above
  3. Optimize performance and refactor code as needed
  4. Gather user feedback and iterate on the game design
