## Notes for Reviewers

Two features have been implemented so far:

1. Time Manipulation: Allows the player to slow down, speed up, or reverse time.
2. Gravity Wells: Adds attractive and repulsive gravity wells that affect the snake's movement.

Please review these implementations and provide feedback. The remaining features will be implemented in subsequent pull requests.
