## Notes for Reviewers

Two features have been implemented so far:

1. Time Manipulation: Allows the player to slow down, speed up, or reverse time.
2. Gravity Wells: Adds attractive and repulsive gravity wells that affect the snake's movement.

## Human Intervention

It stopped implemting after 2 PRs and the results we're great, though they did do something.
